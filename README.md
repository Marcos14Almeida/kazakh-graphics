Ajudei uma amiga do Cazaquist√£o a plotar alguns gr√°ficos para a li√ß√£o da faculdade dela.

"–ù–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ç–µ–±—è ü•∫"
"You need to get data from a table.  write the years from 2000 to 2006 on the bottom. write the numbers 50, 90, 130, 170, 210, 250, 290 on the side. There should be three graphics, the first from the second column, the second from the fourth column and the third one just straight down."
"You see, the numbers in these columns are declining from year to year, we need to make a corresponding schedule."
